# The Back Story: 

*** Since React is based on JavaScript, it’s essential to have a good grasp of the language before you start learning React. *** 

*** I recommend a comprehensive resource like The Modern JavaScript Tutorial for an in-depth review. But if you feel confident about most of JavaScript and just need a brush-up, here’s my recommended list of crucial topics: *** 

## 1. Template Literals

Template literals simplify string interpolation and multiline text formatting. By using backticks (`___` ), you can embed expressions into strings with ${}. This makes concatenating variables and expressions with text easy, eliminating the need for cumbersome string concatenation. 

Additionally, template literals support multiline strings (without needing the newline character, that is \n, and also you can add spaces). This lets developers create more readable and organized code.

With their flexibility and clarity, template literals have become a preferred method for handling strings and dynamic content in modern JavaScript.

## 2. Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and automatically bind this to the context in which they're declared. They are a staple of React development, as they simplify event handlers, lifecycle methods, and other functional logic. Let’s explore different variations of arrow functions.

Arrow Function with a Single Argument: When an arrow function has a single argument, you can omit the parentheses. 

Arrow Function without Arguments: If there are no arguments, you still need to use parentheses.

Arrow Function with Multiple Arguments: For multiple arguments, parentheses are mandatory.

Single-Line Function Body (Implicit Return): When the function body is a single expression, you can omit the return keyword and curly braces. This is known as an implicit return.

Multi-Line Function Body: For more complex logic or multiple statements, you need curly braces, and an explicit return is required if the function returns a value.

Returning an Object: To return an object directly, wrap the object in parentheses to avoid confusion with the function body.

Arrow Functions in Callbacks: Arrow functions are often used as callbacks for array methods like map, filter, and reduce.

## 3. Default Parameters (or Values)

Default parameters allow functions to have pre-set values if no arguments are passed, or when an argument is undefined. This feature is helpful when writing flexible components in React, where you may not always pass every prop or argument.

It is relevant to mention here that there’s another commonly used approach in JavaScript, which is leveraging logical operators like || to set a default value when the given value is falsy (that is, values like 0, null, undefined, false, or "").

## 4. Destructuring Objects and Arrays

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and properties from objects into variables. This concise syntax makes your code cleaner and more readable.

To extract specific values from an array or object, use destructuring by enclosing the desired variables within curly braces for objects or square brackets for arrays.

Destructuring is commonly used in React for handling props and state. To see more specific use cases of destructuring with code examples, read this quick reference on destructuring.
